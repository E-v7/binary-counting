# binary-counting
This program will count in binary up to a user set BITMAX (ex. BITMAX = 4, program will count to 1111). This was also a recreation of an old program I had written in C++ so my goal was to improve on the efficiency of the program and save space. This time around I used bit manipulation to acheive a much smaller program that was highly efficient compared to the previous version.
